Python project-Search algorith comparer

The main aim is to implement the visualization and comparison of different searching algorithms.

Introduction: There are several search algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence each differ in how to find the next state and choose the action from different available states. They seek the same goal for the same problem in the search space, but they still can differ in their performance. Based on the technique used and the problem itself, they can end up with different solutions (or no solution at all). Some can find the optimal solution, some check all available solutions, and some can end up with no solution at all. This project purpose: is to do a graphical representation for the main uninformed search algorithms and identify the characteristics of each algorithm in a graphical way. These characteristics are:

Time: How much time (how many nodes) taken to find the solution?
Space: How much memory space needed to reach the solution?
Optimality: Does the algorithm find the optimal solution? (reached the goal with the least amount of cost)
Completeness: Does the algorithm terminate finding a solution? (if one exists) or it will end in an infinite loop without reaching the goal? This project should be able to: I. Read the problem: identify the start/ goal, different states and action paths. II. Apply the different algorithms to the problem to find the solutions. III. Represent the steps taken in graphical way. IV. Compare the results and show the outcome of each algorithm. Future work: this algorithm can be extended to handle more advanced algorithms (e.g.: heuristics/informed search algorithms) and more complicated problems (e.g.: traffic).
